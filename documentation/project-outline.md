# Project Outline
The [ENTSO-E Transparency Platform](https://www.entsoe.eu/about/) hosts a public API that gives access to datasets that record the demand for electricity in the UK and other European countries. Data from the API
provided is refreshed continually, in close to real time.

## API Endpoint
The API can be accessed from [https://transparency.entsoe.eu/api?](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/api? ) 

API documentation can be found in the [online guide](https://transparency.entsoe.eu/content/static_content/Static%20content/web%20api/Guide.html).

## Sample Data
Example electricity useage data can be found on this repository in [data](../data/sample_usage_data.csv)

## Objectives
1. Determine the extent to which each country’s energy demand has been affected by the COVID-19 pandemic
2. Describe how this data could be used in a daily process that monitors each country’s return to normal levels of energy demand.
